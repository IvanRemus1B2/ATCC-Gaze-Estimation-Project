# ATCC-Gaze-Estimation-Project
The project for the gaze estimation for Advanced Topics for Computer Vision.

Implemented a model using Deep Learning to  predict gaze location as pixel coordinates on a screen.
This is based upon a dataset of about 20,000 webcam images with measurements of a persons distance to the camera.
The architectures for the models trained are inspired from ResNet and VGG.
